Why Lisp?
---

<!-- 
### `(address "elephant in the room")` Chances are, you have some familiarity
with programming languages from the Algol family: C, C++, Java, Python, and
maybe even Perl.

Chances are, then, that Lisp looks really weird.

What are we gaining by placing the parentheses where we do? The answer lies in a
concept programming language theorists call *homoiconicity*. That means that the
language is written in the exact same data structures that the language
supports! Those who have taken a compilers class (disclaimer: I haven't!) know
that compilers parse source code and generate something called an Abstract
Syntax Tree to determine how to evaluate your code. Well, it turns out in Lisp,
the code you write is already an AST.

Alan Kay, on Lisp

> "Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will
> have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better
> programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp
> itself a lot."
<br> &ndash;
Eric Raymond, "How to Become a Hacker"

> "We were not out to win over the Lisp programmers; we were after the C++
> programmers. We managed to drag a lot of them about halfway to Lisp."
<br> &ndash;
Guy Steele, Java spec co-author

> Lisp has jokingly been called "the most intelligent way to misuse a
> computer". I think that description is a great compliment because it transmits
> the full flavor of liberation: it has assisted a number of our most gifted
> fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts."
<br> &ndash;
Edsger Dijkstra, CACM, 15:10

> "Lisp is a programmer amplifier."
<br> &ndash;
Martin Rodgers (first said by Chuck Moore about Forth)

> "Lisp ... made me aware that software could be close to executable
<br> &ndash;
mathematics." L. Peter Deutsch

> "Lisp is a programmable programming language."
<br> &ndash;
John Foderaro, CACM, September 1991

> "SQL, Lisp, and Haskell are the only programming languages that I've seen
> where one spends more time thinking than typing."
<br> &ndash;
Philip Greenspun

> "Although my own previous enthusiasm has been for syntactically rich languages,
> like the Algol family, I now see clearly and concretely the force of Minsky's
> 1970 Turing Lecture, in which he argued that Lisp's uniformity of structure and
> power of self reference gave the programmer capabilities whose content was well
> worth the sacrifice of visual form."
<br> &ndash;
Robert Floyd, Turing Award Lecture, 1979
