CS95 Syllabus
---

---

**Prerequisites:** CS107 (or equivalent experience), students accepted by application

**Course Goals:**
- Explore benefits of immutability and functional programming (in contrast with stateful object-oriented programming)
  - Complexity
  - Concurrency
  - Testability
- Explore the power of Lisp
  - Macros
  - Flexibility among read time vs. compile time vs. runtime.
  - `(loop (print (eval (read)))`
- Interop with libraries written in host VM
  - Leverage all existing Java/Javascript libraries from Clojure

**NOTE: SYLLABUS BELOW WILL BE UPDATED BEFORE COURSE BEGINS**

Items 1 through 10 below represent each week of the quarter. There will be two 80 minute classes per week: a lecture and a lab session. The lab sessions will serve as a time to put lecture material into practice.

    - Lab session!
        - Solve simple problems during class

    - **First Problem Set** on Clojure Basics. Due Friday of week 3.

3. Functional Programming

    - Concepts:
        - Simplicity:
            - "It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures." - Alan J. Perlis
        - Pure functions and side effects
        - Immutability
        - Recursion!
        - Function composition
        - Higher order functions
        - Interactive code example! (Using [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards)!)
            - Pegthing

    - Lab
        - Work on a problem set during class, **introduce final project** (implement one of the following board games in Clojure!)
            - Settlers of Catan
            - Chess/Go/XiangQi

    - **Second Problem Set** on Functional Programming basis. Due Friday of week 5.

4. Bottom-Up Programming

    - A data-first approach to development
        - Store full application state in an atom
        - Design full application state for game as nested data structure
        - Build state with simple, atomic functions
        - Compose and combine functions to initialize game state.
        - Create simple functions to query application state and change application state.
        - Create a set of top level functions that constitute a state transition in the game.
        - Mock, stub, and test as you go along! Use the REPL to its fullest! Be sure that your program works!

    - Lab: get started on your final projects
    - Example:
        - [https://github.com/markbastian/pirates](https://github.com/markbastian/pirates)

5. Lisp!

    - Reading
        - `(loop (print (eval (read))))`
    - Evaluation
        - "There is no real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime. You can compile or run code while reading, read or run code while compiling, and read or compile code at runtime. Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp's syntax; running code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compiling at runtime is the basis of Lisp's use as an extension language in programs like Emacs; and reading at runtime enables programs to communicate using s-expressions, an idea recently reinvented as XML."

    - Lab: examples of macros!

    - **Third PSET** on bottom-up, data-driven application design and writing macros. Due Friday week 7.

6. More Lisp: Macros!

    - Lab: create user macros
        - `unless`, `with-subs`, `rotatef`

7. Concurrency!

    - Simplicity of Clojure: State, Value, and Identity
    - Delays, Futures, Promises
    - "Basic" parallelism ala pmap
    - Atoms
        - Notifications - Watches / Validators
